Stock Market Dashboard

This project is a web application built using ASP.NET, SQLite, and React that provides real-time stock market data.

ASP.NET handles API calls and data processing in the backend to fetch real-time stock market data from Alpha Vantage. Stores stock data in a local SQLite database for efficient retrieval.
React is used for frontend to display stock summaries and graph visualizations(showing stock trends and key metrics).
